      <p>Investigated the future of axial flux motors applications in comparison with more
        traditional topologies. Review paper presents major parameters for design consideration,
        proposing methods for losses minimization.</p>

      <p>Hand-crank emergency phone charger design for both the body,
        made out of 3D parts, and electrical circuit, with generator and gear box.
        Prototyped and conducted series of testing to verify the design and efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div id="some_text">I guess here is a good place to say I love DIYing things. I strongly believe in right to repair and love making/repairing stuff.
      Here are just some of the projects that I either documented or they are significant enough in my opinion to show them here.

      <p>You probably noticed from the design of this webite it is not made by the webdesign genius and I am not pretending to be one.
        I wanted to gain experience in HTML/CSS/JS and thought creating a portfolio is the greatest way to experiment with web programming.
        To introduce myself to the subject took a wonderful course at Coursera taught by Yaakov Chaikin. Recommend it to anyone new to the field.

      8-bit Computer (SAP-1 Architecture) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="arrow down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Built a processor on breadboards using logic gate ICs, programmed EEPROMs and Microcodes. 
        The assembled architecture consists of the clock, registers, logic unit, RAM, program counter, control logic, and display output.
        The project was inspired by <a href="https://eater.net/" target="_blank">BenEater</a>,
         his videos are great at explaining the basics behind complex computer concepts. Currently working on expanding the memory to have more MicroCodes
        and therefore expand capabilities.</p>
