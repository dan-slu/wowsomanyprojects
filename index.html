      <p>I am designing a NHP detection system for farmers to reduce crop losses. I am developing machine learning
        algorithm to
        identify approaching primates based on the camera and microphone inputs. If any monkeys are detected in the
        field the alert will be sent though an IOT module (MKR NB
        1500). Alerts are sent using an HTTP POST request sent to Discord webhook.</p>

    <div class="some_text">I guess here is a good place to say I love DIYing things. I strongly believe in right to
      repair
      and love making/repairing stuff.
      Here are just some of the projects that I either documented or they are significant enough in my opinion to show
      them here. <br> The projects here are not in particular order, all of them are beautiful and important!

      <p>You probably noticed from the design of this website it is not made by the web design genius and I am not
        pretending to be one.
        I wanted to gain experience in HTML/CSS/JS and thought creating a portfolio is the greatest way to experiment
        with web programming.
        To introduce myself to the subject took a wonderful course at Coursera taught by Yaakov Chaikin. Recommend it to
        anyone new to the field.

      <p>Built a processor on breadboards using logic gate ICs, programmed EEPROMs and microcodes.
        The assembled architecture consists of the clock, registers, logic unit, RAM, program counter, control logic,
        and display output.
        The project was inspired by <a href="https://eater.net/" target="_blank">BenEater</a>,
        his videos are great at explaining the basics behind complex computer concepts. Currently working on expanding
        the memory to have more microcodes and therefore expand capabilities.</p>

      Four Bit Adder &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="arrow down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>This project was done as part of the VLSI class (graduate level). For this project the goal was to design a
        four-bit adder out of n-type and p-type MOSFETs. Combining them into logic gates following the pass transistor
        logic we were able to construct a logic circuit which has 8 inputs and
        5 outputs. Inputs accommodate the required two summation terms which are 4 bits each. The output is the sum of
        the two inputs, which can be a maximum of 5 bits. To test our circuit, we assembled it using the Cadence
        Virtuoso simulation software. By constructing the circuit in simulation, we were not only able to test if it
        performs desired functions, but also calculate its efficiency. To obtain the area of the circuit we even
        assembled the layout of the circuit using the basic elements, such as the Nimp, Pimp, Nwell, metal, etc.</p>

        alt="Picture of an 8 bit CPU made on breadboards">
      <p class="pic_ann">Cadence layout passed both the DRC check, which proves that the circuit complies with the rules
        of the layout construction, and the LVS check, which means that the layout produces the same result as the
        circuit constructed previously out of transistors.</p>

      <p>Discord bot to automate class assignment and channel creation, with some fun features.
        Assigns discord roles to people based on the classes they are taking during a particular semester. If there are
        more than certain number of people taking some class on the server separate channel will be created only
        accessible to those taking the class. Helps connecting students with their peers taking same classes. Students
        use server for group studying and reaching out for help to classmates. 40 active members and counting!</p>
      <p>Bot is running on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP_(computer)" target="_blank">CHIP</a> single-board
        computer. It is now discontinued and very limited information is available online. Thanks to community some of
        the

      NotLed (Analog circuit that powers on LED when contacts are not shorted) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i

    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I designed an analog circuit that controls LED based on the status of contacts. Primary use is for water tanks
        with contacts submerged in
        water. If water drops below the contacts' level LED powers on. The goal was to run the circuit off batteries and
        therefore consumption in stand-by should be minimal.</p>

      <p>I am a heavy sleeper, and even if the alarm manages to wake me up I cannot get myself out of the bed. So, one
        day I
        decided to add a Bluetooth to my coffee machine, so that I can start brewing once I wake up and therefore have a
        reason to get up. I had some relays, Arduino, and HC-05 module around and did not want to completely mess up my
        only coffee machine. Adding relays in parallel to existing buttons and connecting HC-05 through UART, I was able
        to send commands to brewer from my smartphone. </p>

      <p>Telegram, popular messaging app, has stickers. They are like custom emojis, however can be made out of any
        pictures/gifs. I believe stickers can also be made out of sounds. Telegram already has a built-in functionality
        of in-line bots and I want to build on it to add a list of audio recordings that will be sent to chat in form of
        voice message. Project is in progress, currently working on adding new audios. I can successfully send those
        already saved. For storage I am using Telegram channel, so storage is free.</p>

      Laptop charging barrel port to USB Type-C port &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="arrow down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I have a relatively old laptop that I am using to this day as daily driver, and also as a volunteer for all
        kind of modifications. I previously erased all symbols from keycaps, replaced components, but this project is
        the most practical and I can recommend this upgrade. I had a typical barrel jack for charging and replaced
        it with USB Type-C PD circuit. I was lucky, my laptop requires 19.6V as input and type-c circuits provide 20V.
        Gladly, all modern laptops have a built-in regulator, so I did not need to worry about that slight offset.
        Besides just soldering a new jack I wanted to keep the LEDs that indicate charging status. Parts were assembled
        into USB bracket to keep them together.

      Gardening &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="arrow down"></i>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Gardening is fun, especially in the apartment. Plants are great decoration, there is something inside us,
        humans, that wants to take care of alive things, and eating salad out of home-grown tomatoes is just an amazing
        feeling. However, this is a portfolio of engineering projects. I already mentioned in the NotLed project how
        I used that circuitry for auto-watering. It was making sure there is enough water in the reservoir. That project
        was done in just an hour, as we were packing to go for a vacation abroad and suddenly realized plants need
        water. <br> Moreover, plants require sunlight. We have cucumbers, peppers, basil growing on windowsill, but for
        tomatoes we wanted additional sunlight. So, I wired the lamps to hang above them. The wiring is nicely fixed
        along the wall, has a dedicated switch and plugs into the power outlet.
